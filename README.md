Description:
The purpose of this program - Things App - demonstrates the ability to return the position (index) of a value
in an array of values through the uses of a custom method.  This is demonstrated with three arrays
of different data types - Integers, Strings, and Doubles.  The output shows the search value for each array
and the position of the value in the array.
